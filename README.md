This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

A homework assignment meant to run through an array of random users (via randomuser.me in this case), wherein the search progressively narrows the search query with each keystroke, and the user can filter her/his query by category. 

### Current State

I was unable to make this app work and am open to suggestions/direct instruction. 

### Utilities and/or languages

ReactJS

### Acknowledgements

Anthony Briglia, who helped me get the API request(s) to show up in the UI.

### Note the lack of congruence between the search request and result
