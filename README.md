This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

A homework assignment meant to run through an array of random users (randomuser.me), wherein the search progressively narrows the search query with each keystroke, and the user can filter her/his query by category. 

### Current State
